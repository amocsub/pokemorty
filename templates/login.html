    <p>Hello, I'm morty and this is my college project for Mr.Goldenfold class of Computer Science.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm trying to emulate my own pokedex because I love pokemon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I hope my grandpa doesn't see <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection">this</a>. If he does he will try to mess it up just to annoy me</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since security is really important to me I had read a lot about how to make a safe site</p>
    <br>
    <p>This site needs authentication to access your pokedex</p>
    <br>
    <form action="/authenticate" method="POST">
        <br>
        Username: <input type="text" name="username">
        <br>
        Password: <input type="password" name="password">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
        <br>
    </form>

    {% if incorrect_password %}
    <p>Seriously Rick??? It is you, right??? I will tell mom about it...</p>
    {% endif %}

</body>

<!-- Here RickSanchez from dimension C-130 again. This is something Morty won't ever find, dont waste you time bruteforcing and try to access the system and bring me back the code
    I dont remember where I left it because I was busy just...... Saving the world...  Just as we are doing right now...
    Perhaps this hint will help you in the future, I took it from Morty's notebook:

    This may help you to find the code I need to continue with my mission.
